## htrcli network capture — deferred / known limitations

- Response bodies are captured on Chrome (CDP getResponseBody, 64KB cap) but NOT on Firefox (webRequest cannot cheaply read bodies). Firefox network entries are metadata-only.
- The shared debuggerManager is used only by network + dialog capture. The existing trusted-input (cdpInput.ts) and CDP_EVAL paths still do their own chrome.debugger.attach, so running a click/eval command while a capture window is open on the same tab fails with "Already attached". Route those through debuggerManager in a later pass.
- Network mocking/interception (spec §1b) is a separate deferred phase (needs webRequestBlocking + Fetch.enable).

## htrcli dialog handling — known limitations

- The Firefox MAIN-world override is racy against dialogs a page fires before it lands at document_start, and cannot intercept native beforeunload dialogs (Chrome CDP handles beforeunload; Firefox does not).
- Dialog handling shares the refcounted debuggerManager with network capture; the "Already attached" limitation from the network plan's TODO applies here too.
